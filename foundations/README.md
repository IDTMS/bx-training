# foundations

## Overview
This repository provides a structured path for building practical IT, DevOps, and AI-adjacent skills. It starts with local environment setup and progresses toward operating real systems, aligning tooling and workflows with how production teams actually work.

## Who This Is For
- Learners who want to move from theory to disciplined execution in infrastructure and automation.
- Developers, operators, or analysts who need repeatable practices for running Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL) environments.
- Anyone willing to build habits around version control, reproducibility, and observability.

## What You Will Learn
- Managing source control, branching, and collaboration in GitHub.
- Establishing dependable workstations with Python, shell, and system tooling.
- Building and testing scripts that interact with operating systems and services.
- Preparing for advanced topics such as provisioning, deployment pipelines, and applied AI systems, once the foundations are solid.

## Expectations
- Work through sessions in order; each step assumes the prior environment state.
- Verify commands locally and document results before moving forward.
- Treat exercises like production operations: use version control, capture logs, and keep changes reproducible.
- Session 0 focuses on environment readiness; later sessions will build forward incrementally.
